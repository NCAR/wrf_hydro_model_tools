Purpose: create_wrfinput.R is an R script developed for the purpose of creating wrfinput files for
         the WRF-Hydro model. The script produces fields of spatially uniform initial model states
         of soil moisture, soil temperature, soil liquid water content and skin temperature among
         a few other variables necessary for model cold-start initialization. This script allows 
         users to avoid running the WRF program real.exe.  

Authors: NCAR WRF-Hydro team

Created: June 2018
Updated: May 2019

Requirements: R, NCO, and the following R packages: ncdf4 and optparse

Input files:
   geo_em.d01.nc - geogrid file defining the model domain of interest generated by the WRF
                   Preprocessing System (WPS)
   
Output files:
   wrfinput_d01.nc (default filename) - wrfinput file to initialize the Noah-MP land surface model in WRF-Hydro

Usage: ./create_wrfinput.R --geogrid='geo_em.d01.nc' --filltyp=3 --laimo=8 

Important notes:
   * Both filltyp and laimo arguments have default values. However, we recommend that users
     specify values more appropriate for their domain / simulation.
   * For more information and descriptions of these and other optional arguments run the script
     with no arguments.
