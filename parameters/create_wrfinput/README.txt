README_create_WRFinput.txt

Purpose: create_Wrfinput.R is an R script developed for the purpose of creating wrfinput files for the WRF-Hydro model.
         This allows users to avoid running the WRF program real.exe.  

Authors: NCAR WRF-Hydro team

Date: May 2018

Requirements: R, NCO, the ncdf4 R package

Input files:
   geo_em.d01.nc - geogrid file defining the model domain of interest generated by the WRF Preprocessing System (WPS)
   
Output files:
   wrfinput_d01.nc (default filename) - wrfinput file to initialize the land surface model

Instructions (users need to complete the following prior to running the script): 

1. Update script to point to input geogrid file
2. Update script to specify the desired name of the output wrfinput file
3. Update script to specify the desired soil category value to be used in case of conflicts between
   soil water and land cover water cells
4. Update script to specify the desired month to use for leaf area index (LAI) initialization
   (needed for some NoahMP configurations)

Usage: Rscript create_Wrfinput.R
